Pseudo Zen is an online pseudocoder, that makes pseudocoding as easy at it should be. With Pseudo Zen, there's no longer an excuse for not pseudo-coding your projects beforehand.

The editor uses an intuitive and clean visual UI, where entries can be added, moved and removed all within a few clicks. It accentuates what matters while avoiding superfluous clutter. This allows you to just focus on the logic, without getting hung up on syntax.

Projects can also be publicly shared, allowing others to see your thought process. This is ideal for quick mockups to confirm everyone is on the same page, or for impromptu training sessions.
